## About Me

I am currently a second year Ph.D. student at [Decision Intelligence Lab](https://decisionintelligence.github.io/), [School of Data Science and Engineering (DaSE)](https://dase.ecnu.edu.cn/), [East China Normal University (ECNU)](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof.[Jilin Hu](https://hujilin1229.github.io/). 

My research focuses on achieving end-to-end lightweight machine learning and deep learning pipelines to support practical deployment on resource-constrained and edge devices and its applications to time series. I am also interested in related topics such as generative models, inference acceleration and model compression.
